# Discrete Approximations of Integrals

## Grid Points

In size spectrum models we wish to keep track of the abundance of fish for a
continuum of different weights, however in computer simulations we only keep
track of the abundance for weights belonging to a finite set of discrete grid
points. The fish grid points $w_{k}$ give the weights at which we track the
abundance of fish. In mizer the fish grid points are specified by the following
three numbers:

1.  The number of fish grid points $|w|.$
2.  The minimum fish egg size $W_{e}.$
3.  The maximum fish size $W_{+}.$

The vector $w$ has $|w|$ elements, and is such that $w_{1}=W_{e}$ and
$w_{|w|}=W_{+}.$ Also the log of $w$ is a vector with a constant difference
between successive entries. In other words,
$\forall k\in\left\{ 1,..,|w|\right\}$ we have $w_{k}=10^{y_{k}}$ where

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
y_{k}=\log_{10}(W_{e})+(k-1) \Delta x.
\end{equation}
```
where

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\Delta x = \left(\frac{\log_{10}(W_{+})-\log_{10}(W_{e})}{|w|-1}\right)
\end{equation}
```
A vector $\Delta w$ of differences is useful for Riemann sums and PDE schemes.
For each $k\in\left\{ 1,..,|w|\right\}$ this is defined so that
$(\Delta w)_k = (10^{\Delta x} - 1)w_k = w_{k+1}-w_k.$

```{=html}
<!--
as $\left(\Delta w\right)_{k}=w_{k+1}-w_{k}.$ It is most natural
to continue the pattern (that there is a constant ratio between successive
entries of $\Delta w$) to specify $\left(\Delta w\right)_{|w|},$
however, unfortunately the original version of mizer (version 0.3) instead defined
$\left(\Delta w\right)_{|w|}=\left(\Delta w\right)_{|w|-1}.$ 
-->
```
The plankton grid points $w_{k}^{full}$ consist of the fish grid points together
with extra points that refer to smaller weights of plankton, below the fish egg
size. In the current version of mizer the plankton grid points are specified by
setting the smallest considered plankton size $W_{-}.$ .

In order for our fast Fourier transform to work, the log of plankton grid points
must have the same spacing as the log of the $w$ grid points (for fish)
described above. Note that this was not so in previous versions of mizer
(version 0.3, and before), which did allow a different spacing for the plankton
and other grid points.

To define the plankton grid points in mizer we first generate a vector
$(z_1,..,z_m)$ where $\forall k \in \{ 1,\dots,m \}$ we have
$z_k = \log_{10} (W_-) + (k-1) \Delta x,$ where the number of additional
plankton grid points $m$ is such that $z_m = \log_{10}(W_e)-\Delta x$ (note that
the value of $W_-$ may have to be coerced slightly, so that it lies on a grid
point and makes this possible).

The full vector of plankton grid points is then given by the concatenation

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\left(w^{full}_1,..,w^{full}_{|w^{full}|} \right) = \left(10^{z_1},..,10^{z_m},w_1,..,w_{|w|} \right).
\end{equation}
```
The number of plankton grid points is hence $|w^{full}| = m + |w|,$ and the
spacing between successive plankton grid points is
$\Delta w_k ^{full} = (10^{\Delta x} - 1) w^{full} _k.$

```{=html}
<!--

In the current version of mizer the plankton grid points $w^{full}$ are defined such that $\forall k\in\left\{ 1,\dots,|w^{full}|-|w|\right\}$
we have $w_{k}=10^{z_{k}}$ where $z_1 = \log_{10}(W_-),$ and $z_|$

\begin{equation}
z_{k}=\log_{10}(W_{-})+(k-1)\left(\frac{\log_{10}(W_{e}-\left(\Delta w\right)_{0})-\log_{10}(W_{-})}{|w^{full}|-|w|-1}\right),
\end{equation}

and the remaining $|w|$ terms are given by

\begin{equation}
\left(w_{|w^{full}|-|w|+1}^{full},w_{|w^{full}|-|w|+2}^{full},\dots,w_{|w^{full}|}^{full}\right)
=\left(w_{1},w_{2},\dots,w_{|w|}\right).
\end{equation}

This means, if we take the log of $w^{full}$ we get a vector within
which there is a constant spacing between points referring to the
size range of fish, while there is a larger spacing between successive
terms of the vector that refer to weights below that of a fish egg. 

For each $k\in\left\{ 1,\dots,|w^{full}|-1\right\}$ this is defined
as $\left(\Delta w^{full}\right)_{k}=w_{k+1}^{full}-w_{k}^{full}.$
Unfortunately, again, the original version of mizer defined $\left(\Delta w^{full}\right)_{|w^{full}|}$
as being equal to $\left(\Delta w^{full}\right)_{|w^{full}|-1}.$

### Available Energy Integral

The available energy to a predator of species $i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\}$ and
mass $w\in\left[W_{e},W_{+}\right]$ is given by the equation:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{a.i}(w)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(N_{R}(w')+\sum_{j=1}^{s}\theta_{ij}N_{j}(w')\right)\Phi_{i}(w'/w)w'dw'
\end{equation}
```
Here

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{i}(w'/w)=\exp\left[\frac{-\left(\ln(w/(w'\bar{\beta}_{i}))\right)^{2}}{2\sigma_{i}^{2}}\right]
\end{equation}
```
describes how much preference a predator of species $i$ and mass $w$ has for a
prey with mass $w'.$ We use $w'$ to denote the prey mass.Note we use slightly
different notation for $w',$ $\Phi_{i}$ and $\bar{\beta}_{i}$ than the vignette.
The $E_{a.i}(w)$ term has to be calculated each time step in order to determine
the feeding level:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
f_{i}(w)=\frac{\gamma_{i}w^{q}E_{a.i}(w)}{\gamma_{i}w^{q}E_{a.i}(w)+h_{i}w^{n}}
\end{equation}
```
which influences the growth and mortality terms in the McKendrik-von Foerster
equation, and must be re-calculated at each time point.

In the original version of mizer, the available energy is calculated as
$E_{a.i}(w_{k})=P_{s}[i,k]+P_{b}[i,k]$ where:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
P_{s}[i,k]=\sum_{k'=1}^{\left|w\right|}\Phi_{i}\left(\frac{w_{k'}}{w_{k}}\right)\sum_{j=1}^{s}\theta_{ij}N_{j}(w_{k'})w_{k'}(\Delta w)_{k'}
\end{equation}
```
is a left Riemann sum for the available energy from eating other fish and

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
P_{b}[i,k]=\sum_{k'=1}^{\left|w^{full}\right|}\Phi_{i}\left(\frac{w_{k'}^{full}}{w_{k}}\right)w_{k'}^{full}N_{R}\left(w_{k'}^{full}\right)(\Delta w{}^{full})_{k'}
\end{equation}
```
is a left Riemann sum for the available energy from eating on the plankton
spectrum. These terms are calculated in a way that exploits R's vectorized
arithmetic to determine these values for each $i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\}$ and
$k\in\left\{ 1,..,|w|\right\}$ simultaneously.

We say they are \`left' Riemann sums because the value of the integrand on the
left side of each interval is multiplied by the length of that interval, to give
the rectangular area contribution for a given interval/size-bin.

### Mortality Integral

The predation mortality rate for a prey of species $i$ and weight
$w'\in[W_{e},W_{+}]$ equals

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\mu_{p.i}(w')=\sum_{j=1}^{s}\int_{0}^{\infty}\Phi_{j}(w'/w)(1-f_{j}(w))\gamma_{j}w^{q}\theta_{j,i}N_{j}(w)dw.
\end{equation}
```
In the original version of mizer, $\forall i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\} ,$
$\forall k'\in\left\{ 1,..,|w|\right\} ,$ this quantity is approximated by the
Riemann sum

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\mu_{p.i}(w_{k'})=\sum_{j=1}^{s}\theta_{j,i}\sum_{k=1}^{|w|}\Phi_{j}(w_{k'}/w_{k})(1-f_{j}(w_{k}))\gamma_{j}w_{k}^{q}N_{j}(w_{k})(\Delta w)_{k}
\end{equation}
```
# Spectral Integration To Speed Up Mizer

Mizer uses a numeric partial differential equation solver to evolve ecosystem
models forwards in time.

The partial differential equations include convolution integrals to determine
growth and death rates. In the original version of mizer these integrals were
performed using Riemann sums, which made the simulations slow. We have
substantially increased the speed of mizer by using spectral methods (exploiting
the speed of the Fast Fourier Transform) to perform such integrals.

### Spectral Integration For available energy

Now we shall discuss how we use spectral methods to evaluate the available
energy integral:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{a.i}(w)=\int_{0}^{\infty}H_{i}^{*}(w')\Phi_{i}(w'/w)dw',
\end{equation}
```
for $i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\}$ and $w\in[W_{e},W_{+}],$ where

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
H_{i}^{*}(w')=\left(N_{R}(w')+\sum_{j=1}^{s}\theta_{ij}N_{j}(w')\right)w'
\end{equation}
```
To begin with let us transform to the log space by defining
$x=\ln\left(w/W_{-}\right)$ and $y^{*}=\ln\left(w'/W_{-}\right).$ Our problem
hence becomes to evaluate

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{a.i}'(x):=E_{a.i}(W_{-}e^{x})=E_{a.i}(w)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}H_{i}^{*}(W_{-}e^{y^{*}})W_{-}e^{y^{*}}\Phi_{i}(e^{y^{*}-x}).dy^{*}
\end{equation}
```
We need to evaluate $E_{a.i}'(x)$ for each $x\in[X_{e},X_{+}],$ where
$X_{e}=\ln\left(W_{e}/W_{-}\right)$ is the egg size in log space, and
$X_{+}=\ln\left(W_{+}/W_{-}\right)$ is the maximum fish size in log space. Also
note $X_{-}=\ln\left(W_{-}/W_{-}\right)=0$ is the minimum considered plankton
size, in the log space. Let $\beta_{i}=\ln(\bar{\beta}_{i}$), and
$\forall v\in\mathbb{R}$ let $H_{i}(v)=H_{i}^{*}(W_{-}e^{v})W_{-}e^{v},$ and let

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\phi_{i}(v):=\Phi_{i}(e^{v})=\exp\left(\frac{-\left(v+\beta_{i}\right)^{2}}{2\sigma_{i}}\right),
\end{equation}
```
now we can rewrite our integral as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{a.i}'(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}H_{i}(y^{*})\phi_{i}(y^{*}-x)dy^{*}.
\end{equation}
```
Now we make the substitution $y=x-y^{*}$ and rewrite the integral as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{a.i}'(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}H_{i}(x-y)\phi_{i}(-y)dy=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}H_{i}(x-y)\psi_{i}(y)dy,
\end{equation}
```
where $\psi_{i}(v):=\phi_{i}(-v),$ $\forall v\in\mathbb{R}.$ The support of a
function is the set of its inputs that yield a non-zero output. It is
approximately true that $\phi_{i}$ has a support contained in the interval
$[-\beta_{i}-3\sigma_{i},0],$ and we shall assume that this approximation holds
true, so we can rewrite our integral as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{a.i}'(x)=\int_{0}^{\beta_{i}+3\sigma_{i}}H_{i}(x-y)\psi_{i}(y)dy,
\end{equation}
```
When we evaluate this integral for $x\in[X_{e},X_{+}],$ we sample $H_{i}(v),$
for each $v=x-y$ in the interval

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
[X_{e}-\beta_{i}-3\sigma_{i},X_{+}]\subseteq[X_{-},X_{+}]=[0,X_{+}].
\end{equation}
```
Note, we are assuming $X_{-}\leq X_{e}-\beta_{i}-3\sigma_{i}$ holds $\forall i.$

Let us define the period $X_{+}$ functions $\bar{H_{i}}(v)$ and
$\bar{\psi_{i}}(v)$ such that when $v\in[0,X_{+}]$ we have
$\bar{H_{i}}(v)=H_{i}(v)$ and $\bar{\psi_{i}}(v)$=$\psi_{i}(v).$

When we are evaluating $E_{a.i}'(x)$ for each $x\in[X_{e},X_{+}],$ we only
sample the functions $H_{i}$ and $\psi_{i}$ at points contained in the interval
$[0,X_{+}],$ and hence we can rewrite our integral as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{a.i}'(x)=\int_{0}^{\beta_{i}+3\sigma_{i}}\bar{H_{i}}(x-y)\bar{\psi_{i}}(y)dy.
\end{equation}
```
Now since $\forall y\in[0,X_{+}]$ we have
$\bar{\psi_{i}}(y)\neq0\Rightarrow y\in[0,\beta_{i}+3\sigma_{i}],$ we can extend
the upper limit of this integral and write

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{a.i}'(x)=\int_{0}^{X_{+}}\bar{H_{i}}(x-y)\bar{\psi_{i}}(y)dy.
\end{equation}
```
We can approximate this by the Riemann sum

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{a.i}'(x_{l})\thickapprox\sum_{k=1}^{^{|w^{full}|}}\bar{H_{i}}(x_{l}-x_{k})\bar{\psi_{i}}(x_{k})\Delta x.
\end{equation}
```
Here$\forall k\in\left\{ 1,..,|w^{full}|\right\}$ we let
$x_{k}^{full}=\ln(w_{k}^{full}/W_{-}),$ and suppose
$\Delta x=x_{2}^{full}-x_{1}^{full}.$ We can evaluate this Riemann sum using
spectral integration. We let $\mathbb{F}[u]$ denote that fast Fourier transform
of a vector $u$. We can use fast Fourier transforms to evaluate this integral
for all appropriate grid points simultaneously. Let us define

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\left(M_{i}(k)\right)_{k=1}^{|w^{full}|}=\left(\Delta x\right)\mathbb{F}^{-1}\left[\mathbb{F}\left[\left(\bar{H}_{i}(x_{k}^{full}\right)_{k=1}^{|w^{full}|}\right]\times\mathbb{F}\left[\left(\bar{\psi}_{i}(x_{k}^{full}\right)_{k=1}^{|w^{full}|}\right]\right]
\end{equation}
```
For $k\in{1,..,|w|}$ this expression gives the same outputs as our Riemann sum.
Hence we can extract the appropriate values from
$\left(M_{i}(k)\right)_{k=1}^{|w^{full}|}$ by noting that

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\left(E_{a.i}(w_{k})\right)_{k=1}^{|w|}\thickapprox\left(M_{i}(k)\right)_{k=K_{e}}^{|w^{full}|},
\end{equation}
```
where $K_{e}=|w^{full}|-|w|+1.$

### Spectral integration for predation mortality

The predation mortality is given by the integral

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\mu_{p.i}(w)=\sum_{j=1}^{s}\theta_{ji}\zeta_{j}^{*}(w),
\end{equation}
```
where

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{j}^{*}(w)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\Phi_{j}(w/w')Q_{j}(w')dw'
\end{equation}
```
is the mortality rate of a size $w$ prey from predators of species $j,$
disregarding the interaction matrix. The function $\zeta_{j}^{*}(w)$ is called
pred_rate in the code. Since it is also used to compute the predation mortality
rate of the plankton, we wish to evaluate $\zeta_{j}^{*}(w),$ for each
$w\in[W_{-},W_{+}].$

Making the substitutions $x=\ln(w/W_{-})$ and $y'=\ln(w'/W_{-}),$ we can rewrite
this integral as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{j}(x):=\zeta_{j}^{*}(w)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Phi_{j}(e^{x-y'})Q_{j}(W_{-}e^{y'})W_{-}e^{y'}dy'
\end{equation}
```
we wish to evaluate $\zeta_{j}(x),$ for each $x\in[X_{-},X_{+}]=[0,X_{+}].$ Here
$X_{+}=\ln(W_{+}/W_{-})$ and $X_{-}=\ln(W_{-}/W_{-})=0.$

Letting $\phi_{j}(x-y')=\Phi_{j}(e^{x-y'})$ and
$q_{j}(y')=Q_{j}(W_{-}e^{y'})W_{-}e^{y'},$ we can rewrite this integral as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{j}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\phi_{j}(x-y')q_{j}(y')dy'
\end{equation}
```
Letting $y=x-y'$ we can rewrite this integral as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{j}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\phi_{j}(y)q_{j}(x-y)dy,
\end{equation}
```
It is approximately true that $\phi_{j}$ has a support contained in the interval
$[-r_{j},0],$ where $r_{j}:=\beta_{j}+3\sigma_{j}$. We shall assume that this
approximation holds true, so we can rewrite our integral as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{j}(x)=\int_{-r_{i}}^{0}\phi_{j}(y)q_{j}(x-y)dy,
\end{equation}
```
The period $P$ we shall use for spectral integration is

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
P=X_{+}+\max_{j\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\} }\left(r_{j}\right).
\end{equation}
```
Let us define the period $P$ function $\bar{q_{j}}(v)$ such that when
$v\in[0,P]$ we have $\bar{q_{j}}(v)=q_{j}(v).$

Let us define the period $P$ function $\bar{\phi_{j}}(v)$ such that when
$v\in[-r_{j},P-r_{j}]$ we have $\bar{\phi_{j}}(v)=\phi_{j}(v).$

Now when we evaluate $\zeta_{j}(x)$ for each $x\in[0,X_{+}],$ we only sample the
value of $\phi_{j}$ at points contained in the interval $[-r_{j},P-r_{j}]$ and
we only sample $q_{j}$ at points contained in the interval $[0,P].$ At such
points our periodic extensions agree with the original functions, and so we can
rewrite our integral as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{j}(x)=\int_{-r_{i}}^{0}\bar{\phi_{j}}(y)\bar{q_{j}}(x-y)dy,
\end{equation}
```
moreover, since $\forall y\in[-r_{j},P-r_{j}]$ we have
$\bar{\phi_{j}}(y)\neq0\Rightarrow y\in[-r_{j},0]$ we may extend the upper limit
of our integral, and write

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{j}(x)=\int_{-r_{j}}^{P-r_{j}}\bar{\phi_{j}}(y)\bar{q_{j}}(x-y)dy.
\end{equation}
```
Now since $\bar{\phi_{j}}(y)\bar{q_{j}}(x-y)$ is a period $P$ function in $y,$
we can rewrite it as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{j}(x)=\int_{0}^{P}\bar{\phi_{j}}(y)\bar{q_{j}}(x-y)dy.
\end{equation}
```
$\forall k\in\left\{ 1,..,|w^{full}|\right\}$ let
$x_{k}^{full}=\ln(w_{k}^{full}/W_{-}),$ and suppose
$\Delta x=x_{2}^{full}-x_{1}^{full}.$ Note that $x_{k}^{full}=(k-1)\Delta x.$
Let us define a longer vector $x^{P}$ with $|x^{P}|=1+(P/\Delta x)$ elements.
such that $\forall k\in\left\{ 1,..,|x^{P}|\right\}$ we have
$x_{k}^{P}=(k-1)\Delta x$. Now we can approximate this integral by a Riemann
sum, for $l\in{1,..,|w^{^{full}}|},$ by writing

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{j}(x_{l})\thickapprox\sum_{k=1}^{^{|x^{P}|}}\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{k})\bar{q_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{k})\Delta x.
\end{equation}
```
We let $\mathbb{F}[u]$ denote that fast Fourier transform of a vector $u$. We
can use fast Fourier transforms to evaluate this Riemann sum for all appropriate
grid points simultaneously. Now let us define

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\left(L_{j}(k)\right)_{k=1}^{|x^{P}|}=\left(\Delta x\right)\mathbb{F}^{-1}\left[\mathbb{F}\left[\left(\bar{q}_{j}(x_{k}^{P}\right)_{k=1}^{|w^{P}|}\right]\times\mathbb{F}\left[\left(\bar{\phi}_{i}(x_{k}^{P}\right)_{k=1}^{|w^{P}|}\right]\right].
\end{equation}
```
Now we have

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\left(\zeta_{j}^{*}(w_{k}^{full})\right)_{k=1}^{|w^{full}|}=\left(\zeta_{j}(x_{k}^{full})\right)_{k=1}^{|w^{full}|}\thickapprox\left(L_{j}(k)\right)_{k=1}^{|w^{full}|},
\end{equation}
```
as required.

### Riemann sum comparison for available energy

The available energy to a predator of species $i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\}$ and
mass $w\in[W_{e},W_{+}]$ is

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{a.i}(w)=\int_{0}^{\infty}H_{i}^{*}(w')\Phi_{i}(w'/w)dw',
\end{equation}
```
for $i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\}$ and $w\in[W_{e},W_{+}],$ where

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
H_{i}^{*}(w')=\left(N_{R}(w')+\sum_{j=1}^{s}\theta_{ij}N_{j}(w')\right)w'
\end{equation}
```
is the available biomass of food of mass $w'$ for species $i,$ and

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{i}(w'/w)=\exp\left(\frac{-\ln\left(\frac{w}{w'\bar{\beta_{i}}}\right)^{2}}{2\sigma_{i}}\right),
\end{equation}
```
measures how much preference predators of weight $w$ and species $i$ have for
prey of weight $w'.$ Here $\beta_{i}:=\ln\left(\bar{\beta_{i}}\right).$

In the original version of mizer, if we discount the differences in how the grid
points $w^{full},$ $\Delta w$ and $\Delta w^{full}$ are defined then we can
write the approximation (i.e., the Riemann sum) that the original version of
mizer uses for $E_{a.i}(w_{l})$ as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{i,l}^{^{M}}=\sum_{k=1}^{|w^{full}|}H_{i}^{*}(w_{k})\Phi_{i}(w_{k}/w_{l})\times(\Delta w)_{k},
\end{equation}
```
where $\left(\Delta w\right)_{k}=w_{k+1}-w_{k}.$

In our new code we use spectral integration to approximate the available energy,
and this corresponds to approximating $E_{a.i}(w_{l})$ by the Riemann sum

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{i,l}^{F}=\sum_{k=1}^{|w^{full}|}\bar{H_{i}}(x_{l}-x_{k})\bar{\psi_{i}}(x_{k})\Delta x.
\end{equation}
```
Here $\forall k\in\mathbb{Z}$ we have $w_{k}=W_{-}e^{x_{k}}.$ Here $W_{-}$
denotes the minimum considered plankton size, $W_{e}$ denotes the egg size, and
$W_{+}$ denotes the maximum possible fish size. Also, note $w_{1}=W_{-},$ and
$w_{K_{e}}=W_{e}$ and $w_{|w^{full}|}=W_{+}.$ In the log space we have that
$X_{-}=\ln(W_{-}/W_{-})=0$ corresponds to the minimum considered plankton size,
$X_{e}=\ln(W_{e}/W_{-})$ corresponds to the fish egg size, and
$X_{+}=\ln(W_{+}/W_{-})$ corresponds to the maximum possible fish size.

We shall now use substitutions to transform this sum into a form which we can
more easily compare with $E_{i,l}^{^{M}}.$

Suppose $q$ is such that $x_{q}=x_{l}-x_{k},$ now

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
x_{l}-x_{k}=(l-1)\Delta x-(k-1)\Delta x=(l-k)\Delta x=(q-1)\Delta x
\end{equation}
```
so $q=1+l-k.$ Changing $E_{i,l}^{F}$ into a sum over $q$ instead of $k$ gives us

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{i,l}^{F}=\sum_{q=1+l-|w^{full}|}^{^{l}}\bar{H_{i}}(x_{q})\bar{\psi_{i}}(x_{l}-x_{q})\Delta x.
\end{equation}
```
In terms of the discrete grid points we are using, the functions $\bar{H_{i}}$
and $\bar{\psi_{i}}$ both have a period of $|w^{full}|.$ It follows that
$\bar{H_{i}}(x_{q})\bar{\psi_{i}}(x_{l}-x_{q})$ has a period of $N$ with respect
to $q,$ and since our sum is over $N$ successive terms, it follows that if we
sum over $N$ other successive terms we will get the same result, and so we can
write

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{i,l}^{F}=\sum_{q=l}^{|w^{full}|}\bar{H_{i}}(x_{q})\bar{\psi_{i}}(x_{l}-x_{q})\Delta x,
\end{equation}
```
here $\forall q\in\left\{ 1,..,|w^{full}|\right\} ,$ we have
$\bar{H_{i}}(x_{q})=H_{i}^{*}(w_{q})w_{q}$ so we can write

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{i,l}^{F}=\sum_{q=l}^{|w^{full}|}\bar{\psi_{i}}(x_{l}-x_{q})H_{i}^{^{*}}(w_{q})w_{q}\Delta x.
\end{equation}
```
Now since $x_{l}\in[X_{e},X_{+}]$ and $x_{q}\in[0,X_{+}]$ we have
$x_{l}-x_{q}\in[X_{e}-X_{+},X_{+}].$ There are two possibilities for the type of
form $\bar{\psi_{i}}(x_{l}-x_{q})$ takes.

One possibility is that $x_{l}-x_{q}\in[0,X_{+}].$ In this case we have

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\bar{\psi_{i}}(x_{l}-x_{q})=\psi_{i}(x_{l}-x_{q})=\phi_{i}(x_{q}-x_{l})=\Phi_{i}(w_{q}/w_{l}).
\end{equation}
```
The other possibility is that $x_{l}-x_{q}\in[X_{e}-X_{+},0).$ In this case we
have

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\bar{\psi_{i}}(x_{l}-x_{q})=\psi_{i}(x_{l}-x_{q}+X_{+})
\end{equation}

where $x_{l}-x_{q}+X_{+}\in[X_{e},X_{+}).$ However, since the support of
$\psi_{i}$ is contained in the interval $[0,\beta_{i}+3\sigma_{i}],$ where (by
assumption) $X_{e}<\beta_{i}+3\sigma_{i},$ we must also have that

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\bar{\psi_{i}}(x_{l}-x_{q})=\psi_{i}(x_{l}-x_{q}+X_{+})=0=\psi_{i}(x_{l}-x_{q})
\end{equation}
```
holds in this case.

Hence we have shown that

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\bar{\psi_{i}}(x_{l}-x_{q})=\psi_{i}(x_{l}-x_{q})=\Phi_{i}(w_{q}/w_{l}),\forall x_{l}\in[X_{e},X_{+}],\forall x_{q}\in[0,X_{+}],
\end{equation}
```
hence we can write

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
E_{i,l}^{F}=\sum_{q=l}^{^{|w^{full}|}}\Phi_{i}(w_{q}/w_{l})H_{i}^{^{*}}(w_{q})w_{q}\Delta x,
\end{equation}
```
we can see that this has just the same form as the the original version of mizer
Riemann sum $E_{i,l}^{M}$, except that our rectangles here have width
$w_{q}\Delta x,$ unlike in $E_{i,l}^{M}$ where they have width $(\Delta w)_{q}.$

### Riemann sum comparison for predation mortality

The predation mortality rate of a prey of species $i$ and mass $w$ can be
written as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\mu_{p.i}(w)=\sum_{j=1}^{s}\theta_{j,i}\zeta_{j}^{*}(w)
\end{equation}
```
where $\forall i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\} ,$ $\forall w\in[0,W_{+}],$ we have
that

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{j}^{*}(w)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\Phi_{j}(w/w')Q_{j}(w')dw'
\end{equation}
```
is the predation rate on prey with mass $w$ from predators of species $j$ when
the interaction matrix is discounted (i.e., when we assume the interaction
matrix is full of ones). Here $\zeta_{j}^{*}(w)$ is known as pred_rate in the
new fft mizer code. Here

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
Q_{j}(w')=(1-f_{j}(w'))\gamma_{j}\left(w'\right){}^{^{q^{*}}}N_{j}(w').
\end{equation}
```
In the original version of mizer , $\zeta_{j}^{*}(w_{l})$ is essentially
approximated by the Riemann sum

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{j,l}^{M}=\sum_{k=1}^{^{|w^{full}}|}\Phi_{j}(w_{l}/w_{k})Q_{j}(w_{k})(\Delta w)_{k}.
\end{equation}
```
In our new code we use spectral integration to approximate the predation
mortality rate, and this corresponds to approximating $\zeta_{j}^{*}(w_{l})$ by
the Riemann sum

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{i,l}^{F}=\sum_{k=1}^{|x^{P}|}\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{k})\bar{q_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{k})\Delta x
\end{equation}
```
where

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
P=x_{|x^{P}|}=(|x^{P}|-1)\Delta x=X_{+}+r
\end{equation}
```
where

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
r=\max_{i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\} }(\beta_{i}+3\sigma_{i}).
\end{equation}
```
We shall now use substitutions to transform this sum into a form which we can
more easily compare with $\zeta_{j,l}^{M}.$

Suppose $v$ is such that $x_{v}=x_{l}-x_{k},$ now

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
x_{l}-x_{k}=(l-1)\Delta x-(k-1)\Delta x=(l-k)\Delta x=(q-1)\Delta x
\end{equation}
```
so $v=1+l-k.$ Changing $E_{i,l}^{F}$ into a sum over $v$ instead of $k$ gives us

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{i,l}^{F}=\sum_{v=1+l-|x^{P}|}^{l}\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{v})\bar{q_{j}}(x_{v})\Delta x
\end{equation}
```
Now since $\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{v})\bar{q_{j}}(x_{v})$ is a period $|x^{P}|$
function with respect to $v,$ and $\zeta_{i,l}^{F}$ is a summation involving
$|x^{P}|$ successive values of this function, we can rewrite this sum as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{i,l}^{F}=\sum_{v=1}^{|x^{P}|}\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{v})\bar{q_{j}}(x_{v})\Delta x.
\end{equation}
```
For such $v\in\left\{ 1,..,|x^{P}|\right\}$ we have
$\bar{q_{j}}(x_{v})=q_{j}(x_{v})=Q_{j}(w_{v})w_{v},$ so we can write

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{i,l}^{F}=\sum_{v=1}^{|x^{P}|}\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{v})q_{j}(w_{v})\Delta x,
\end{equation}
```
now since $q_{j}(x_{v})=Q_{j}(w_{v})w_{v}$ and the support of $Q_{j}(w_{v})$ is
contained in $[W_{-},W_{+}],$ it must be that the support of $q_{j}(x_{v})$ is
contained in $[0,X_{+}],$ and so we have

where $v\in\left\{ |x^{full}|+1,..,|x^{P}|\right\} \Rightarrow q_{j}(x_{v})=0,$
hence we can rewrite our summation as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{i,l}^{F}=\sum_{v=1}^{|x^{full}|}\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{v})q_{j}(x_{v})\Delta x.
\end{equation}
```
Now since $q_{j}(x_{v})=Q_{j}(w_{v})w_{v}$ in this range, we have

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{i,l}^{F}=\sum_{v=1}^{|x^{full}|}\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{v})Q_{j}(w_{v})w_{v}\Delta x.
\end{equation}
```
Now since $x_{l},x_{v}\in[0,X_{+}]$ we must have $x_{l}-x_{v}\in[-X_{+},X_{+}],$
and so we have two possibilities to consider, to understand the form of
$\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{v}).$

The first possibility is that $x_{l}-x_{v}\in[-X_{+},0].$ In this case

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{v})=\phi_{j}(x_{l}-x_{v})=\Phi_{j}(w_{l}/w_{v}).
\end{equation}
```
The other possibility is that $x_{l}-x_{v}\in(0,X_{+}].$ In this case

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{v})=\phi_{j}(x_{l}-x_{v}-P),
\end{equation}
```
where $x_{l}-x_{v}-P\in(-P,-r]$ since $P=X_{+}+r.$ Now since the support of
$\phi_{j}$ is contained in $[-r,0],$ with $\phi_{j}(-r)\rightarrow0,$ we have

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{v})=\phi_{j}(x_{l}-x_{v}-P)=0=\phi_{j}(x_{l}-x_{v}),
\end{equation}
```
and so we have shown that

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\bar{\phi_{j}}(x_{l}-x_{v})=\phi_{j}(x_{l}-x_{v})=\Phi_{j}(w_{l}/w_{v}),\forall x_{l},x_{v}\in[0,X_{+}].
\end{equation}
```
It follows that we can rewrite our summation as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{i,l}^{F}=\sum_{v=1}^{|x^{full}|}\Phi_{j}(w_{l}/w_{v})Q_{j}(w_{v})w_{v}\Delta x.
\end{equation}
```
we can see that this has just the same form as the the original version of mizer
Riemann sum $\zeta_{i,l}^{M}$, except that our rectangles here have width
$w_{q}\Delta x,$ unlike in $\zeta_{i,l}^{M}$ where they have width
$(\Delta w)_{q}.$
